# EMMA shiny applcation

This is the version of the EMMA application submitted to the [UN global pulse data for climate action challange](http://dataforclimateaction.org/). Our submission recevied a [Thematic award](https://www.datamakespossible.com/fires-cape-south-africa-data-watch/). For more details on the science behind EMMA, take a look at this post by the lead author [Jasper Slingsby](http://www.ecologi.st/post/emma/)

The application displays detected exceedances of predicted limits for healthy fynbos vegetation, and allows the user to visualize high-resolution satellite data from Planet Labs. You will need a api key from Planet labs to access this capability. Add your api key in the `get_planet.r` script
